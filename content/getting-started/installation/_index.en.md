Great! You’ve made the choice to protect and speed up your WordPress site by going static. Now, let’s walkthrough the installation process.

Installing the plugin is done just like any other WordPress plugin. If you've done that before, this should be the usual process. If this is your first time, or it's been a while, no worries, we're going to walkthrough the whole process.

There are a few ways you can install this plugin:

 - [from inside your WordPress dashboard's plugin search](#via-dashboard)
 - [by uploading a ZIP file through your WordPress dashboard](#via-dashboard)
 - [using the command line tool, WP-CLI](#via-cli)
 - directly uploading a ZIP/folder to the fileserver
 - via the [Must Use Plugins](https://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins) special directory

As part of the installation, you will also need to [Activate](#activation) the plugin before use.

You can also [Install other versions of the plugin](#installing-other-versions-of-the-plugin), such as the latest development version or an older version, in case something is incompatible with your site in the current official version.

## Installing other versions of the plugin

To install the latest development version of the plugin, you can get the source code from the [GitHub project](http://github.com/leonstafford/wordpress-static-html-plugin/). 

Installing a previous official release is possible, by going to the WP Static Site Generator’s Advanced page on wp.org and choosing from the menu at the bottom of the page.  

To upload either the latest or a particular version of the plugin that you have as a ZIP file, click on the **Uload Plugin** button and locate the ZIP file of the plugin from your computer.

## Installing via WP-CLI {#via-cli}

For advanced users, you can also install WP Static Site Generator via [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/) with `wp plugin install static-html-output-plugin --activate`.

## Activating the plugin {#activation}

If you didn't already do it as part of one of the steps above, go to your WordPress dashboard's Plugins page, find **WP Static Site Generator** from the list of plugins and click the **Activate** link to enable it for use.
After activation, you can opt-in to improve the plugin’s performance.
