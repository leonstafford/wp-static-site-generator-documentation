Adding a search engine to your static site
------------------------------------------

Another functionality that you get for free with WordPress is the
built-in search mechanism. The way this works is by querying the
database for the search terms you enter. This is great, but is also
another point that can slow down your website. The more things that are
requesting information at once add to site slow down. Caching queries
can help a bit, but not all of your users are going to search for the
same terms, so there's still an initial cost for each new search term.
But you publish your WordPress site statically because you want real
*speed* and no database sitting there, looking all slow and insecure.
