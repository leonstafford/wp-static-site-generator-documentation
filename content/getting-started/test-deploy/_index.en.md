## Doing your first test deploy

When you first open the plugin's settings page, it will default to the **Same server** deployment option.

This is the best way to quickly generate a static copy of your site and be able to preview how it will look, without needing to worry about any other configuration. 

Simply hit the **Start static export** button and wait while it crawls your site, making a static version of every page.

Don't worry, this is not going to overwrite anything on your website!

After exporting your site, click the **Go to my static site** button, which will open the static version of your site in a new tab. 

Now you've got a feel for how the plugin works, you can move on to [Deploying your site](#) to one of the many static site hosting options, or play around with the [Configuration](#), where you can adjust things to speed up the crawling process or ensure certain files are excluded/included from the export.
