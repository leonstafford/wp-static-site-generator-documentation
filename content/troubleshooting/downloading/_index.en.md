### How can I download an older version of the plugin?

Sometimes, you have a known previous version of the plugin which you want to keep using for a certain case. 

Previous version of the plugin may be downloaded from the bottom of the plugin's [Advanced Page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/advanced/).
