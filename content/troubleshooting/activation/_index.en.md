Error when trying to activate the plugin
----------------------------------------

This is usually caused by an out of date PHP version.  You may see an
error such as

> Fatal error: Can't use function return value in write context in ...

The current officially supported PHP versions can be found on [PHP.net]

Whilst the plugin tries to work on the most common PHP environments, it
currently requires PHP 5.4 or higher.

As official security support drops for PHP 5.6 at the end of 2018, it is
strongly recommended to upgraded your WordPress hosting environment to
PHP 7, ideally, PHP 7.1 or 7.2, as 7.0 will also stop being supported in
December, 2018.

For help on upgrading your environment, please email
