title: Deployment Options
---

WP Static Site Generator allows you to deploy to a massive amount of hosting options, allowing you to choose from the fastest, the most full featured, the cheapest (free) or somewhere in between.

Anywhere you can host a regular WordPress website can be used for hosting a static website. Even on the same web host, the static version of your site should perform much better, especially under some load.

Once you are considering to go static, though, you have such a great many more options of hosting to choose from, that we'd like to give a bit of guidance here, in helping you find the best suited to your needs/style.
